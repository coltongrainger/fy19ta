Write your answer in the space provided.

1.  Consider the function $f(x) := x^3(x - 1)^4(x - 2)^2$. Which of the
    following **is true**?

    (A) $0$, $1$, and $2$ are all critical points and all of them are
        points of local extrema.

    (B) $0$, $1$, and $2$ are all critical points, but only $0$ is a
        point of local extremum.

    (C) $0$, $1$, and $2$ are all critical points, but only $1$ and $2$
        are points of local extrema.

    (D) $0$, $1$, and $2$ are all critical points, and none of them is a
        point of local extremum.

    (E) $1$ and $2$ are the only critical points.
