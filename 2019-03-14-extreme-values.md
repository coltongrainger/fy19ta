This is an **ungraded** quiz that will count for attendance; it is due by the end of recitation.

## Definitions

Let $f$ be a function and $A$ a set of numbers contained in the domain of $f$. (If you like, you may assume $A$ is an interval of real numbers, like $(a,b)$ or $(-\infty, \infty)$ or $[a,b]$. However, these definitions hold for *any set* of numbers $A$ in the domain of $f$.)

1. A point $x_{\text{max}}$ in $A$ is a **maximum point** for $f$ on $A$ if $$f(x_{\text{max}}) \ge f(x)\qq{for every $x$ in $A$.}$$

    i. The number $f(x_{\text{max}})$ is called the **maximum value** of $f$ on $A$. 
    ii. We also say that $f$ "has its maximum value on $A$ at $x_\text{max}$".

2. A particular number $y_\text{above}$ is a **bound** for $f$ on $A$ if $$y_\text{above} \ge \abs{f(x)} \qq{for every $x$ in $A$.}$$

3. A point $x_\text{local}$ in $A$ is a **local maximum point** for $f$ on $A$ if:

> *There is a positive number $\delta > 0$ such that $x_\text{local}$ is a maximum point for $f$ on the set* $$\{\text{points in $A$ whose distance to $x_\text{local}$ is less than $\delta$}\}.$$

## Short answer

What part(s) of which definition(s) above should be modified to instead define a **minimum point** and the **minimum value** for a function $f$ on $A$?

List five numbers, in decreasing order, that bound the function $\arctan \colon \RR \to (-\frac \pi 2, \frac \pi 2)$.

Suppose the function 
$$f(x) := \begin{cases} -x^2 &\text{ if $-1< x <1$}\\ 0 & \text{ if $x\le -1$ or $x \ge 1$}\end{cases}$$ 
represents force (N) in the positive $x$-direction on the head of a pendulum when the pendulum is displaced by $x$ (cm) from equilibrium. If there is a local maximum point for $f$ on $\RR$, find it; else, find a local minimum point for $f$ on $\RR$.

4.  Suppose $f$ and $g$ are increasing functions from $\RR$ to $\RR$. (Recall that a function $g$ is **increasing** on an interval if $g(a) < g(b)$ whenever $a$ and $b$ are two numbers in the interval with $a < b$.) Which of the following functions is *not* guaranteed to be an increasing function from $\RR$ to $\RR$?

    (A) $f + g$
    (B) $f \cdot g$
    (C) $f \circ g$
    (D) All of the above, i.e., none of them is guaranteed to be
        increasing.
    (E) None of the above, i.e., they are all guaranteed to be
        increasing.
