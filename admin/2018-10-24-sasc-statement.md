My experience as a social work intern and as a teaching assistant motivates my application for the open SASC position.

In the two years between my undergraduate and my start at CU, I interned at a refugee resettlement agency in Houston, TX and at an overnight shelter in Olympia, WA. I owe my understanding of pedagogy to my first supervisor, Shaoli Bhadra, the refugee medical care coordinator in Houston. Shaoli demonstrated that social work was critical pedagogy *applied*. For example, to remove barriers that individuals with limited English proficiency faced when accessing healthcare, we had both to *educate* clinicians (petitioning them to expand the scope of their services) and to *connect* with clients (building on their own skills and self-sufficiency).

This view of pedagogy, along with my mathematical curiosity, informs my teaching: I aim to be rigorous, engaging, and inclusive. If I were to lead a SASC coseminar, believe I would leverage my mathematical ability against prior knowledge from social work. For this reason, I believe I am a good fit for the open SASC position.

To list my prior teaching experience:

- Analytical Physics I (PHY-271 at the College of Idaho), TA, Dr. Kathrine Devine, Fall 2015
- Calculus 1 (MATH 1300), TA, Dr. Lee Roberson, Fall 2018
