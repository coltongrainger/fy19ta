> Explain the parameters of your interest in SASC, e.g. interested in working for SASC now, in future, in certain circumstances, etc.

I hope to work for SASC for 2 consecutive semesters during Fall 2019, Spring 2020, or Fall 2020. (I plan to comp Spring 2021, and then plan to take a reduced teaching assignment.) 

> Application Question 1:  Why are you interested in working for the Student Academic Success Center?

I aim to work with SASC to "dissect and disarm mechanisms that lead to inequalities in mathematical fields" [SC15]

[SC15]: The Statement of Commitment to Equity in Mathematics

Specifically, I have observed SASC coseminars with Caroline Matson, and I have been encouraged to apply for a SASC role by Sarah Salmon.

> Application Question 2: How do you believe that your current skills will contribute to the accomplishment of SASC’s goals and mission? 

My mathematical praxis is informed by:

1. Two years of service work. From Fall 2016 to Spring 2017, I interned at a refugee resettlement agency in Houston, TX; then Fall 2017 to Spring 2018, I served as an AmeriCorps VISTA at an overnight shelter in Olympia, WA. 

2. Evidence-based pedagogical research. To prepare for classes, I focus four classes of questions [Han13]. These are: (a) Knowledge-centered, i.e., What do I want students to be able to accomplish? Why? (b) Learner-centered, i.e., How can I help students build on and refine their prior knowledge? (c) Assessment-centered, i.e., How can I frequently reveal the progress students have made? (d)  Community-centered, i.e., How do I capitalize on the community of learners and society at large?

3. Desire for positive student outcomes. I see myself as a member of a community of mathematicians responsible for establishing "the bedrock of [students'] post-secondary preparation for science and engineering" [BMR15].

> Application Question 3: How do you provide students with feedback regarding their learning?


> Application Question 4:  Scenario: A student in your class has missed several class sessions and tells you that they’re juggling a full-time job at the moment. What advice/plan would you discuss with them? 


> Are you available Mondays from 3-4pm and Thursdays from 3-4pm for department meetings?
