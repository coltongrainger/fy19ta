> Explain the parameters of your interest in SASC, e.g. interested in working for SASC now, in future, in certain circumstances, etc.

I could work for SASC for 2 consecutive semesters during Fall 2019, Spring 2020, or Fall 2020. (I plan to comp Spring 2021, and then plan to take a reduced teaching assignment.) 

> Application Question 1:  Why are you interested in working for the Student Academic Success Center?

I aim to work for SASC as to support "dissecting and disarming mechanisms that lead to inequalities in mathematical fields" [Ta19]. (I will try develop this statement in my reply to the next question.)

I came to know about SASC from three senior graduate students in the mathematics department. In particular, Sarah Salmon encouraged me to apply to SASC for Spring 2019, while Caroline Matson later discussed her curriculum design with me and arranged for me to observe a Calc 2 coseminar.

> Application Question 2: How do you believe that your current skills will contribute to the accomplishment of SASC’s goals and mission? 

My contribution to the accomplishment of SASC's goals would be to serve as a graduate student teaching assistant, where my mathematical praxis is informed by:

1. Service work. 

    Fall 2016 to Spring 2017, following my bachelor's degree at the College of Idaho, I interned in the case management department of a refugee resettlement agency in Houston, TX. Then, Fall 2017 to Spring 2018, while applying to graduate schools, I worked at an shelter for families experiencing homelessness in Olympia, WA. 

2. Preparation and reflection. 
    
    Before and after my classes, whether I am an instructor or a learner, I consider four types of questions (adapted from [Ha13] and [NRC]). These are: (i) Knowledge-centered, i.e., What do I want students to be able to accomplish? Why? (ii) Learner-centered, i.e., How can I help students build upon and refine their prior knowledge? (iii) Assessment-centered, i.e., How can I frequently reveal the progress students have made? (iv) Community-centered, i.e., How do I capitalize on the community of learners and society at large?

3. Desire for the positive student outcomes in the calculus sequence. 

    I am a member of a community^[1] tasked to provide mathematics education. Now, because calculus is seen to be "the bedrock of students' post-secondary preparation" [BMR15] for science and engineering, I am especially concerned with the success of students through the calculus sequence. Hence, as a graduate student, I believe I have the comparative leverage to support equity in the scientific community by focusing on equity in calculus. 

    In my praxis, equity is measured in terms of the success of individuals in a group. This perspective is due to my interactions with supervisors (Shaoli Bhadra in Houston) and educators (Dave Rosoff at the College of Idaho) for whom an individual client's or student's success^[2] was the *only* goal of their work. Naturally then, as I take on more responsibility for students, I look to emulate Shaoli and Dave, and I recall that I am *only*^[2] doing my job when individuals have efficacy to achieve their own successes. 

^[1] : Namely, the community of graduate students and faculty in the mathematics department, but also broadly speaking, as in Tod Wayman's *Did I Miss Anything?*, (1993).

^[2] : We recognize that, in both social work and education, what an individual's "success" actually looks like may be unpredictable. However, there are concrete lower bounds to be met in terms of health, personal safety, access to resources, etc.

^[3] : Of course, one must make some sort of obligatory remark about self-care here, which might be summarized as "Take care of yourself, too!"

> Application Question 3: How do you provide students with feedback regarding their learning?

## Formative feedback

- Written feedback for technical mistakes/achievements.
- Oral feedback for conceptual mistakes/achievements. (By asking leading questions. By keeping an open mind when trying to determine what prior knowledge might have lead to the conclusion. Or, if possible, by encouraging students to give feedback to each other, then moderating.)
- Posting statistical feedback on a (private?) class website (e.g., solutions with distributions of correct answers uploaded to a dropbox).
- Immediate feedback! Multiple choice!
- Long term feedback. Typed solutions to exercises.
- Spaced feedback. (By recalling tricky concepts over spaced intervals.)

## Summative feedback 

- Being available in person at regular, predictable times. (That is, by demonstrating a willingness to give feedback about any questions whatsoever. By being straight forward about not knowing the answer to a particular question. By being well connected to quickly locate a good answer or a resource to push the student in the right direction.)
- Occasionally email reminders.
- Big picture discussions. Proofs of hard theorems at the end of the semester. 
- Reflections.

> Application Question 4:  Scenario: A student in your class has missed several class sessions and tells you that they’re juggling a full-time job at the moment. What advice/plan would you discuss with them? 

Triage! (The remaining details vary. My goal would be to sanely prioritize with them. I would set a calendar reminder for myself to follow up with the student the next class, and the next week if necessary.)

> Are you available Mondays from 3-4pm and Thursdays from 3-4pm for department meetings?

Yes.
