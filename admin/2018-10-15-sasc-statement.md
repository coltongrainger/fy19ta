# Statement of interest

My unique, bimodal experience as a intern in social work and as a teaching assistant motivates my application for the open SASC position. 

In the two years between my undergraduate and my start at CU, I interned at a refugee resettlement agency in Houston, TX and at a cold-weather shelter in Olympia, WA. During this time, I was deeply influenced by my supervisors, notably Shoali Bhadra, the program coordinator for medical case management. She understood our tasks in social work as applications of critical pedagogy. For example, to remove barriers individuals that low-English literacy faced when accessing healthcare, we had both to educate clinicians (petitioning them to expand the scope of their services) and to connect with clients (building their skills and self-sufficiency). 

I have brought this broad notional of pedagogy and it's applicability to CU. It informs my teaching philosophy: to be rigorous, to be engaging, and to be inclusive.

Moreover, from discussion with the current graduate students teaching in SASC, I believe that leading a coseminar would leverage my mathematical ability against my experience in social work. 

For these reasons, I believe I am a strong candidate for the open SASC position. Thank you for your consideration.
