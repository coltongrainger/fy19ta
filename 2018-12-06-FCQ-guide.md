## Epigrams

**Mary-Claire van Leunen** (*Mathematical Writing*. Donald E. Knuth, Tracy L. Larrabee, and Paul M. Roberts, 1989)

```
Many years ago Mary-Claire was a frequent passenger on the Chicago bus system.
The neighborhood where she boarded her #5 bus was a gathering spot for "bummy
guys" ... Some begged, others peddled. Among the peddlers---hawking wares
ranging from trenchcoats full of watches to freedom from the peddler's
presence---was a man whom May-Claire patronized quite regularly. He sold pencil
stubs (obviously collected from trash bins); but Mary-Claire said his patter
was charming enough to rate one or two pencils a week.

"These pencils are magic pencils," he would say. "Buy a magic pencil. Only 25 cents."

"What's a magic pencil?" would come the expected response.

"With this pencil, you can write *the truth*."

Inevitably, someone would pipe up, "But I can write lies with it."

"Oh, you break the magic. But if you really believe, you can write *the truth*."
```

**Richard Hamming** (talk at Bellcore, 7 March 1986):

    Therefore, go forth and become great scientists!

**Tom Wayman** (*Did I Miss Anything?*, 1993)

```
Nothing. When we realized you weren’t here
we sat with our hands folded on our desks
in silence, for the full two hours

     Everything. I gave an exam worth
     40 percent of the grade for this term
     and assigned some reading due today
     on which I’m about to hand out a quiz
     worth 50 percent

Nothing. None of the content of this course
has value or meaning
Take as many days off as you like:
any activities we undertake as a class
I assure you will not matter either to you or me
and are without purpose

     Everything. A few minutes after we began last time
     a shaft of light suddenly descended and an angel
     or other heavenly being appeared
     and revealed to us what each woman or man must do
     to attain divine wisdom in this life and
     the hereafter
     This is the last time the class will meet
     before we disperse to bring the good news to all people  on earth.

Nothing. When you are not present
how could something significant occur?

     Everything. Contained in this classroom
     is a microcosm of human experience
     assembled for you to query and examine and ponder
     This is not the only place such an opportunity has been gathered

     but it was one place

     And you weren’t here
```
