Print your **full name** and **three digit section number** in the top right corner. This is just a fun quiz. Sketch a graph if you feel inclined. Credit to Vipul Naik for writing the quiz [@Na12].

1.  "The Reaction Time game is a game used to measure people's reaction
    time. When people start playing the game, their reaction time is in
    the 250-300ms range. We find that repeatedly playing the Reaction
    Time game causes the average reaction time to drop (allowing for
    random fluctuation as well as day-to-day variation on account of the
    person's physiological state). However, it does not approach zero
    but rather converges toward an *asymptotic* positive value of
    150ms."

2.  "Our website traffic shows significant seasonal variation, with
    seasonal peaks during the US academic year and seasonal troughs
    during the summer vacation. We also have weekly periodic variation,
    with intra-week highs Monday - Thursday and lows Friday - Sunday.
    Controlling for seasonal variation, daily traffic to our website is
    growing by 1000 pageviews per day every year."

3.  "The instructor was sued under discrimination law because the letter
    grades he assigned on the test were not a *non-decreasing function*
    of the students' raw score on the test."

4.  "Opportunity cost and the reality of trade-offs mean that the common
    welfare will not be maximized if all resources are exclusively used
    in the production of wheat, nor if none are. Rather, the optimal
    amount of resources that ought to be devoted to wheat production
    lies in the middle. It is the middles, not the extremes, that are
    best for the common welfare."

5.  "The most pernicious forms of laziness and complacency arise when
    you are at a *local maximum* and are therefore unwilling to take a
    temporary dip in order to strive toward the bigger *absolute
    maximum*."

6.  "Every day, the daily sales at my lemonade stand go up by one, so
    the cumulative sales so far are a *quadratic function* of the number
    of days I have kept my lemonade stand open."

7.  "My Facebook friend count continues to grow, but the rate at which
    it is growing is steadily decreasing as I have to spend more and
    more time on work and less and less time on meeting new people
    outside my immediate friend circle."

8.  "In small quantities, enzyme $C$ acts as a catalyst for its own
    creation (heard of autocatalysis?). However, once the quantity of
    enzyme $C$ exceeds a certain threshold value, it acts as an
    inhibitor for its own creation. The biochemical reaction that
    produces enzyme $C$ thus begins slowly, speeds up, and then reaches
    an *inflection point* after which it starts slowing down and
    eventually tapers off to zero. (Think of the graphs for the quantity
    of $C$ produced and the rate of $C$ produced per unit time)."
