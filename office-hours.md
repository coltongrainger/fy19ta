MATH 1300 is a five-hour course that meets in small sections. It covers the standard topics in a first-semester calculus course (limits, derivatives, integrals, applications, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus). As your TA, *please connect with me* to get the most out of the course.

From Richard Hamming (talk at Bellcore, 7 March 1986):

> *Therefore, go forth and become great scientists!*

<!---[^mendelssohn]: And so be heard: 

    > *Ich harrete des Herrn, und er neigte sich zu mir und hÃ¶rte mein Flehn.*
    >
    > I waited patiently for the Lord, and He inclined to me and heard my complaint. 
    > 
    > (MWV A 18, aus der Sinfonie Nr. 2 in B-Dur "Lobgesang")
