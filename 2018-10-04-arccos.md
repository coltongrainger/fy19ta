We find the derivative of $\theta = \arccos{x} = \cos^{-1} x$ with respect to $x$.

Simplify the equation by taking the cosine of both sides:

\begin{align*}
\theta &= \cos^{-1} x\\
\cos \theta &= x
\end{align*}

Now take the derivative of both sides of the equation with respect to $x$ and solve for $\frac{d\theta}{dx}$. We appeal to the *chain rule* to change the variable of differentiation.

\begin{align*}
\cos \theta &= x\\
\frac{d}{dx} [\cos \theta] &= \frac{d}{dx} [x]\\
\frac{d}{d\theta} [\cos \theta] \frac{d\theta}{dx} & = 1\\
(-\sin \theta) \cdot \frac{d\theta}{dx} &=1\\
\frac{d\theta}{dx} &= \frac{-1}{\sin \theta}
\end{align*}

We want to rewrite this in terms of $x = \cos \theta$. How? Recall

\begin{align*}
\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta &=1\\
\sin^2 \theta &= 1 - \cos^2 \theta\\
\sin \theta &= \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta}\\
    &\text{(Note $\sin \theta \ge 0$ on the range of $\theta = \cos^{-1} x$)}.
\end{align*}

Substitution implies

\begin{align*}
\frac{d\theta}{dx} &= \frac{-1}{\sin \theta}\\
    &= \frac{-1}{\sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta}}\\
    &= \frac{-1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
\end{align*}

We made a choice between a positive a negative square root when solving for $\sin{\theta}$. We choose the positive root because we usually define $\cos^{-1} x$ to have outputs between $0$ and $\pi$, and the sine function is positive (or zero) on this interval.
