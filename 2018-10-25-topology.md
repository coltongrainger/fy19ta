Print your **full name** and **three digit section number** in the top right corner.

- A **function** is a rule $f$ that assigns to each element of some set $A$ an element of some other set $B$. 
- We write $f \colon A \to B$ to display all the ingredients together. 
- The set $A$ is called the **domain** of $f$.

1. $\arcsin$ assigns elements of the set [?] to the set [?]

    (A) $[-1,1] \to[0, \pi]$
    (A) $[-1,1] \to[-\frac\pi2, \frac\pi2]$
    (A) $[-\frac\pi2, \frac\pi2] \to [-1,1]$
    (A) All of the above
    (A) None of the above

2. $\arccos$ assigns elements of the set [?] to the set [?]

    (A) $[-1,1] \to[0, \pi]$
    (A) $[-1,1] \to[-\frac\pi2, \frac\pi2]$
    (A) $[-\frac\pi2, \frac\pi2] \to [-1,1]$
    (A) All of the above
    (A) None of the above

3. $\arctan$ assigns elements of the set [?] to the set [?]

    (A) $\RR \to (-1,1)$
    (A) $(-\frac\pi2, \frac\pi2) \to \RR$
    (A) $\RR \to (-\frac\pi2, \frac\pi2)$
    (A) All of the above
    (A) None of the above

- A subset of $\RR$ is **closed** if it "contains its boundary." 

4. Which of the following intervals are closed?

    (A) the domain of $\arctan$
    (A) the domain of $\arcsin$
    (A) $[-1,1) = \{x : -1 \le x \le 1\}$
    (A) $(-1,1] = \{x : -1 <   x \le 1\}$
    (A) None of the above

- An **open interval** $(a,b)$ is the set of numbers $\{x : a < x < b\}$. 
- A subset $O$ of $\RR$ is **open** if for each point $x \in O$, there's an interval $(a,b)$ that contains $x$ and is contained in $O$.

5. The domain of $\arctan$ is open.

    - TRUE
    - FALSE
