Print your **name** and **three digit section number** in the top right corner, attempt^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru>] the problems, and return this page to me. Your answers do not count towards your final grade, but your attendance does. You have about $2$ minutes a question.

- Consider the function $f(x) := x^2 + 1$. What is the polynomial describing $f(f(x))$?

  (A) $x^2 + 2$
  (A) $x^4 + x^2 + 1$
  (A) $x^4 + x^2 + 2$
  (A) $x^4 + 2x^2 + 1$
  (A) $x^4 + 2x^2 + 2$

- If $f(g(x)) = 5$ and $f(x) = x+3$ for all real $x$, then $g(x) =$

  (A) $x-3$
  (A) $3-x$
  (A) $\frac{5}{x+3}$
  (A) $2$
  (A) $8$

- For all positive functions $f$ and $g$ of the real variable $x$, let $\sim$ be a relation defined by $$f \sim g \text{ if and only if } \lim_{x\to \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 1.$$ 
  Which of the following is NOT a consequence of $f \sim g$?

  (A) $f^2 \sim g^2$
  (A) $\sqrt{f} \sim \sqrt{g}$
  (A) $e^f \sim e^g$
  (A) $f + g \sim 2g$
  (A) $g \sim f$
