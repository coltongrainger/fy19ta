- We call a function $f$ left continuous on an open interval $I$ if, for all $a \in I$, $\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = f(a)$. Which of the following is an example of a function that is left continuous but not continuous on $(0,1)$?

  (A) $f(x) := \bigg\lbrace\begin{array}{rl}x, & 0 < x \le 1/2 \\ 2x, & 1/2 < x < 1 \\\end{array}$
  (A) $f(x) := \bigg\lbrace\begin{array}{rl}x, & 0 < x < 1/2 \\ 2x, & 1/2 \le x < 1 \\\end{array}$
  (A) $f(x) := \bigg\lbrace\begin{array}{rl}x, & 0 < x \le 1/2 \\ 2x - (1/2), & 1/2 < x < 1 \\\end{array}$
  (A) $f(x) := \bigg\lbrace\begin{array}{rl}x, & 0 < x < 1/2 \\ 2x - (1/2), & 1/2 \le x < 1 \\\end{array}$
  (A) All of the above

- Suppose $f$ and $g$ are functions $(0,1)$ to $(0,1)$ that are both left continuous on $(0,1)$. Which of the following is *not* guaranteed to be left continuous on $(0,1)$? Last year's performance: $4/13$ correct

  (A) $f + g$, i.e., the function $x \mapsto f(x) + g(x)$
  (A) $f - g$, i.e., the function $x \mapsto f(x) - g(x)$
  (A) $f \cdot g$, i.e., the function $x \mapsto f(x)g(x)$
  (A) $f \circ g$, i.e., the function $x \mapsto f(g(x))$
  (A) None of the above, i.e., they are all guaranteed to be left continuous functions

- Consider the function $$f(x) := \bigg\lbrace\begin{array}{rl} x, & x \text{ rational }\\1/x, & x \text{ irrational }\\\end{array}$$ 
  What is the set of all points at which $f$ is continuous?

  (A) $\{ 0, 1 \}$
  (A) $\{ -1,1 \}$
  (A) $\{-1,0 \}$
  (A) $\{ -1,0,1 \}$
  (A) $f$ is continuous everywhere


- Define the base $e$ of the "natural" exponential function. Hint: The derivative of every exponential function of the form $f(x) := a^x$ with $a>0$ is equal to a multiple of itself $f'(x) = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{a^{x+h} -a^x}{h} = a^x \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{a^h-1}{h}$.

  (A) $e = \lim_{h\to 0} e^h$
  (A) $e$ is the number that satisfies $\log(1) = e$
  (A) $e = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{e^h}{h}$
  (A) $e$ is the number that satisfies $e^{x+y} = e^xe^y$ for all $x,y \in \mathbf{R}$
  (A) $e$ is the number that satisfies $\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{e^h-1}{h} = 1$
